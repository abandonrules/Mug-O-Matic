# Mug-O-Matic & the TINY CNC Collection
The Mug-O-Matic is a tiny CNC robot capable of doing real work: Customizing coffee mugs! 

It is one possible configuration from a collection of modules designed to be low cost and have lots of replay value through customization. This robot offers kids an opportunity to learn Arduino, the most common language for physical computing. No soldering or bread-boarding required, controls are all plug and play. 

All 60 unique 3D printed components are designed for replication, modularity, and to provide maximum performance given their low cost. To that end parts do not require build supports or post processing, and assemblies can accommodate printing variance. 

The intent of the project is to produce a unique and accessible educational tool. One that encourages children to engage in tinkering and making things because those activities are powerful ways to learn and inspire people to pursue STEM careers.
